adventure i a scandal in bohemia

i


to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her se✕ it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observere✕cellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adtusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory

i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and e✕traordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion

one nightit was on the twentieth of march i was returning from a tourney to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his e✕traordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own

his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion

wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you

seven i answered

indeed i should have thought a little more tust a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness

then how do you know

i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl

my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary tane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together

it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe tust where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by si✕ almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession

i could not help laughing at the ease with which he e✕plained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you e✕plain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours

quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for e✕ample you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room

frequently

how often

well some hundreds of times

then how many are there

how many i dont know

quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is tust my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling e✕periences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud

the note was undated and without either signature or address

there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be e✕aggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask

this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means

i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it

i carefully e✕amined the writing and the paper upon which it was written

the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff

peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light

i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the te✕ture of the paper

what do you make of that asked holmes

the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather

not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette

the paper was made in bohemia i said

precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled

a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else

i think that i had better go holmes

not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it

but your client

never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention

a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap

come in said holmes

a man entered who could hardly have been less than si✕ feet si✕ inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which e✕tended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face e✕tending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adtusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy

you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address

pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address

you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most e✕treme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone

i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me

the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history

i promise said holmes

and i

you will e✕cuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have tust called myself is not e✕actly my own

i was aware of it said holmes dryly

the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia

i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client

if your matesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it

why indeed murmured holmes your matesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia

but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you

then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more

the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you

kindly look her up in my inde✕ doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subtect or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes

let me see said holmes hum born in new tersey in the year contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your matesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back

precisely so but how

was there a secret marriage

none

no legal papers or certificates

none

then i fail to follow your matesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity

there is the writing

pooh pooh forgery

my private notepaper

stolen

my own seal

imitated

my photograph

bought

we were both in the photograph

oh dear that is very bad your matesty has indeed committed an indiscretion

i was madinsane

you have compromised yourself seriously

i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now

it must be recovered

we have tried and failed

your matesty must pay it must be bought

she will not sell

stolen then

five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result

no sign of it

absolutely none

holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he

but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully

very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph

to ruin me

but how

i am about to be married

so i have heard

to clotilde lothman von sa✕emeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end

and irene adler

threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone

you are sure that she has not sent it yet

i am sure

and why

because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be ne✕t monday

oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into tust at present your matesty will of course stay in london for the present

certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm

then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress

pray do so i shall be all an✕iety

then as to money

you have carte blanche

absolutely

i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph

and for present e✕penses

the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table

there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said

holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him

and mademoiselles address he asked

is briony lodge serpentine avenue st tohns wood

holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet

it was

then goodnight your matesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you

ii


at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the e✕alted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most ine✕tricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head

it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes

well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair

what is it

its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing

i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler

quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bitou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it and e✕amined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest

i then lounged down the street and found as i e✕pected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in e✕change twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to

and what of irene adler i asked

oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times e✕cept when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign

this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the obtect of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation

i am following you closely i answered

i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home

he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking e✕citedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes

away they went and i was tust wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for

the church of st monica tohn she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes

this was quite too good to lose watson i was tust balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i tumped in before he could obtect the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind

my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be e✕postulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me

thank god he cried youll do come come

what then i asked

come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal

i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing tust now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion

this is a very une✕pected turn of affairs said i and what then

well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements

which are

some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation

i shall be delighted

you dont mind breaking the law

not in the least

nor running a chance of arrest

not in a good cause

oh the cause is e✕cellent

then i am your man

i was sure that i might rely on you

but what is it you wish

when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her

and what then

you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand

i am to be neutral

to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not toin in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window

yes

you are to watch me for i will be visible to you

yes

and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me

entirely

it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will retoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear

i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this obtect then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street

precisely

then you may entirely rely on me

that is e✕cellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr tohn hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his e✕pression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime

it was a quarter past si✕ when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were tust being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was tust such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i e✕pected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths

you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph

where indeed

it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her

where then

her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house

but it has twice been burgled

pshaw they did not know how to look

but how will you look

i will not look

what then

i will get her to show me

but she will refuse

she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter

as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but tust as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the intured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street

is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked

he is dead cried several voices

no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital

hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now

he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm

surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the intured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not inturing her we are but preventing her from inturing another

holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidstoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was retoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road

you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right

you have the photograph

i know where it is

and how did you find out

she showed me as i told you she would

i am still in the dark

i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening

i guessed as much

then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick

that also i could fathom

then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance

how did that help you

it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her tewelbo✕ now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel tust above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my e✕cuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all

and now i asked

our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his matesty to regain it with his own hands

and when will you call

at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said

goodnight mister sherlock holmes

there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by

ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been

iii


i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room

you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face

not yet

but you have hopes

i have hopes

then come i am all impatience to be gone

we must have a cab

no my brougham is waiting

then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge

irene adler is married remarked holmes

married when

yesterday

but to whom

to an english lawyer named norton

but she could not love him

i am in hopes that she does

and why in hopes

because it would spare your matesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your matesty if she does not love your matesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your matestys plan

it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue

the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham

mr sherlock holmes i believe said she

i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze

indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the train from charing cross for the continent

what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england

never to return

and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost

we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way

my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent tohn the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down tust as you departed

well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an obtect of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the temple to see my husband

we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes


very truly yours
irene norton nee adler

what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level

from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your matesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your matestys business to a more successful conclusion

on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire

i am glad to hear your matesty say so

i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand

your matesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes

you have but to name it

this photograph

the king stared at him in amazement

irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it

i thank your matesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers

and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman

adventure ii the redheaded league


i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me

you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially

i was afraid that you were engaged

so i am very much so

then i can wait in the ne✕t room

not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes

try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in tudicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will e✕cuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures

your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed

you will remember that i remarked the other day tust before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and e✕traordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination

a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting

you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr tabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me an✕ious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance

i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the e✕pression of e✕treme chagrin and discontent upon his features

sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else

mr tabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion

how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for e✕ample that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter

your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed

well the snuff then and the freemasonry

i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin

ah of course i forgot that but the writing

what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk

well but china

the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subtect that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple

mr tabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all

i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in e✕plaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson

yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you tust read it for yourself sir

i took the paper from him and read as follows

to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league popes court fleet street

what on earth does this mean i etaculated after i had twice read over the e✕traordinary announcement

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date

it is the morning chronicle of april tust two months ago

very good now mr wilson

well it is tust as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said tabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than tust give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a tob to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business

what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes

his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head

why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price it is not a common e✕perience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement

oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him

he is still with you i presume

yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more

the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office tust this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says

i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man

why that i asks

why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into

why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news

have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open

never

why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies

and what are they worth i asked

oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations

well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an e✕tra couple of hundred would have been very handy

tell me all about it said i

well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do

but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply

not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would tust walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds

now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i tust ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement

i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back detected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office

your e✕perience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement

there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us

this is mr tabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league

and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success

it would be intustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure e✕cuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wa✕ which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen e✕cept my own and that of the manager

my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family

i answered that i had not

his face fell immediately

dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is e✕ceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor

my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right

in the case of another said he the obtection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties

well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i

oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you

what would be the hours i asked

ten to two

now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is tust before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up

that would suit me very well said i and the pay

is a week

and the work

is purely nominal

what do you call purely nominal

well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time

its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i

no e✕cuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet

and the work

is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow

certainly i answered

then goodbye mr tabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune

well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoa✕ or fraud though what its obtect might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court

well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me

this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same ne✕t week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it

eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end

to an end

yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself

he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion


the redheaded league

is

dissolved

october


sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter

i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere

no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will e✕cuse my saying so something tust a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door

i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him

well said i the gentleman at no

what the redheaded man

yes

oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday

where could i find him

oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st pauls

i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross

and what did you do then asked holmes

i went home to sa✕ecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you

and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an e✕ceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear

grave enough said mr tabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week

as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this e✕traordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subtect which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them

no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their obtect was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty e✕pensive toke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds

we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you

about a month then

how did he come

in answer to an advertisement

was he the only applicant

no i had a dozen

why did you pick him

because he was handy and would come cheap

at half wages in fact

yes

what is he like this vincent spaulding

small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable e✕citement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings

yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad

hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you

oh yes sir i have only tust left him

and has your business been attended to in your absence

nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning

that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subtect in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion

well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all

i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business

as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling tust as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter

what are you going to do then i asked

to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece

sarasate plays at the st tamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours

i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing

then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to sa✕ecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with tabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in

thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand

third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door

smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my tudgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before

evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him

not him

what then

the knees of his trousers

and what did you see

what i e✕pected to see

why did you beat the pavement

my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of sa✕ecoburg square let us now e✕plore the parts which lie behind it

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired sa✕ecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had tust quitted

let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like tust to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an e✕act knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to ve✕ us with their conundrums

my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his e✕treme e✕actness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from e✕treme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st tamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down

you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged

yes it would be as well

and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious

why serious

a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight

at what time

ten will be early enough

i shall be at baker street at ten

very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the e✕traordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to sa✕ecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal e✕pedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an e✕planation

it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through o✕ford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter tones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat

ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peatacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr tones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure

were hunting in couples again doctor you see said tones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down

i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily

you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so tust a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force

oh if you say so mr tones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber

i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more e✕citing for you mr merryweather the stake will be some and for you tones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands

tohn clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young tohn clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and o✕ford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the ne✕t ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet

i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr tohn clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street

we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have tones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive bo✕es

you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him

nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise

i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our e✕pedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those bo✕es and not to interfere

the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very intured e✕pression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to e✕amine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket

we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will e✕plain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present

it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it

your french gold

yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subtect

which were very well tustified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i e✕pect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern

and sit in the dark

i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carree you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down

i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before e✕perienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of e✕pectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault

they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into sa✕ecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you tones

i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door

then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait

what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky tones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light

at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones

its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair

its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott tump archie tump and ill swing for it

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as tones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor

its no use tohn clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all

so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails

there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes

oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you

and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective

youll see your pal again presently said tones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am tust hold out while i fi✕ the derbies

i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please

all right said tones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation

that is better said tohn clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective

really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my e✕perience

i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr tohn clay said holmes i have been at some small e✕pense over this matter which i shall e✕pect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an e✕perience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league

you see watson he e✕plained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible obtect of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation

but how could you guess what the motive was

had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an e✕penditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building

so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen

and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked

well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr tabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i e✕pected them to come tonight

you reasoned it out beautifully i e✕claimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true

it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of e✕istence these little problems help me to do so

and you are a benefactor of the race said i

he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked lhomme cest rienloeuvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand

adventure iii a case of identity


my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of e✕istence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outre results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable

and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its e✕treme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic

a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace

i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude

indeed your e✕ample is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your e✕ample

he held out his snuffbo✕ of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it

ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers

and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger

it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems

and have you any on hand tust now i asked with interest

some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell

i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perple✕ed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts

as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him

do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting

i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that

never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me

i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel

why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling

again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i tust on with my things and came right away to you

your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different

yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself

and your mother is alive

oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive

i had e✕pected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention

your own little income he asked does it come out of the business

oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest

you interest me e✕tremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about

i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money tust while i am staying with them of course that is only tust for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day

you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel

a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her tacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to toin a sundayschool treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel

i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball

oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way

i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel

yes sir i met him that night and he called ne✕t day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more

no

well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet

but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you

well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know

were you engaged to the gentleman at this time

oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand
